            I'm mainly a Web Developer, but I also enjoy UI/UX and Graphic Design as a hobby. I'm
            currently a graduating student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology,
            expected to graduate in 2025.
          </p>

            Design has been my focus since high school, but college shifted my passion to web
            development, especially back-end development.

            I'm dedicated to learning and growing, always working on new skills and exploring
            technologies to make a positive impact. No matter what challenges come my way, I live by
            the mindset: "Stay curious and keep moving forward."
