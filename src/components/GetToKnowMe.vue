        I'm mainly a Web Developer, but I also enjoy UI/UX and Graphic Design as a hobby. I'm
        currently a graduating student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology,
        expected to graduate in 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        Design has been my focus since high school, but college shifted my passion to web
        development, especially back-end development.

        I'm dedicated to learning and growing, always working on new skills and exploring
        technologies to make a positive impact. No matter what challenges come my way, I live by the
        mindset: "Stay curious and keep moving forward."
